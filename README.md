# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

In this project we built a web app with dashboards that have 158 anonymous peoples belly button samples. The team of researchers and those who participated in the study will be able to visit a webpage and select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species from their belly button live in their navels.  Out database has demographic info of all participants. By selecting ID number, we will be able to see following applications:

- Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found 
- Belly Button Washing Frequency per Week
- Bacteria Cultures per Sample
